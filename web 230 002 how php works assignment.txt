1.) Server side scripting produces a customized response for each client's request, while client side scripting uses embedded scripts, such as javascript, to run a client side web browser. Both techniques are frequently used together.
2.) The difference between scripting languages is that scripting languages are interpreted rather than compiled. Scripting languages do not need to be compiled and created to execute the file.
3.) PHP is a server-side scripting language used as a general purpose programming language. PHP code is processed and impemented as a module in the web server. The web server software then combines the results of the interpreted and executed code with the generated web page.
4.) When the client sends a request to the server, the server sends a request to a file to get information, which then sends a document that the browser can render back to the client.
5.) HTTP GET allows the user to see what is being passed over. GET requests remain in browser history, can be bookmarked, and have length restrictions. GET requests can also be cached. POST requests, on the other hand, do not remain in the browser history, cannot be bookmarked, and have no restrictions on data length. They also can never be cached.
